A simple quality of life mod that swaps between chestplate and elytra on a keystroke. 
The default key is "grave accent" ("Â²" on the AZERTY layout) but it can be changed in the options of the game.

## Requirements

## Disclamer

Some public servers do not allow this kind of mods and can detect them if you use it badly (spam the key, swap while pressing a deplacement key). You should check the server's rule before using it on a public server. I am not responsible for the consequences of inapropriate use of this mod.
